It converts the x1 and x2 columns to datetime format, filling any missing x2 values with the x1 value of the next row (except for the last row, which is ignored if x2 is missing). It calculates the total energy produced and the total duration in hours (we multiply the power by 1/6 , as the reading is taken every 10 minutes) for each file, along with the corresponding day. The results are stored in a list, sorted by date, and then saved to a CSV file named energy_stats_2021_2022_2023.csv."
